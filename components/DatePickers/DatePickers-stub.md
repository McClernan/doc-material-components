## Mobile date pickers

Mobile date pickers can be used to select dates in the near future or past, when it’s useful to see them in a calendar month format. They are displayed in a dialog.

Common use cases include:

* Making a restaurant reservation
* Scheduling a meeting
They aren’t ideal for selecting dates in the distant past or future that require more navigation, such as entering a birth date or expiration date.

Mobile date pickers allow selection of a single date and year.

### Mobile date picker example

* A title that reads "Select a date"
* A selected date in the format "\<day of the week\>, \<month\>, \<year\>"
* A switch-to-keyboard input icon
* A year selection menu
* Month pagination
* Current date
* Selected date (your choice)

## Mobile date range pickers

Mobile date range pickers allow selection of a range of dates. They cover the entire screen.

Common use cases include:

* Booking a flight
* Reserving a hotel

### Mobile date range picker example

**Note to developers: provide code and a screenshot an example mobile date range picker with the following:**
* A title that reads "Select a date range"
* A current date

## Desktop date pickers

Desktop date pickers allow the selection of a specific date and year. The desktop date picker displays a date input field by default, and a dropdown date appears when the user taps on the input field. The user can interact with either form of date entry.

Desktop date pickers are ideal for navigating dates in both the near future (or past) and the distant future (or past), as they provide multiple ways to select dates.

Desktop date pickers supports tooltips to provide users additional instructions to use date pickers.
