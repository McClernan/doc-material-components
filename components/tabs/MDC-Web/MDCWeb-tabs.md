# Tabs

[Tabs](https://material.io/components/tabs/) organize content across different screens, data sets, and other interactions.

There are two types of tabs:
1. [Fixed tabs](#fixed-tabs)
1. [Scrollable tabs](#scrollable-tabs)

### Making tabs accessible


## Fixed tabs

Fixed tabs display all tabs on one screen, with each tab at a fixed width. The width of each tab is determined by dividing the number of tabs by the screen width. They donâ€™t scroll to reveal more tabs; the visible tab set represents the only tabs available.

## Scrollable tabs

Scrollable tabs are displayed without fixed widths. They are scrollable, such that some tabs will remain off-screen until scrolled.### Fixed tab example
