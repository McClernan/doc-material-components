# Dialogs

Dialogs inform users about a task and can contain critical information, require decisions, or involve multiple tasks.

There are four types of dialogs:

1. [Alert](#alert-dialog)
1. [Simple](#simple-dialog)
1. [Confirmation](#confirmation-dialog)
1. [Full-screen](#full-screen-dialog)

## Using dialogs

A dialog is a type of modal window that appears in front of app content to provide critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed, or a required action has been taken.

Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.

## Alert dialog

Alert dialogs interrupt users with urgent information, details, or actions.

## Simple dialog

Simple dialogs can display items that are immediately actionable when selected. They don’t have text buttons.

As simple dialogs are interruptive, they should be used sparingly. Alternatively, dropdown menus provide options in a non-modal, less disruptive way.

## Confirmation dialog

Confirmation dialogs give users the ability to provide final confirmation of a choice before committing to it, so they have a chance to change their minds if necessary.

If the user confirms a choice, it’s carried out. Otherwise, the user can dismiss the dialog. For example, users can listen to multiple ringtones but only make a final selection upon tapping “OK.”

## Full-screen dialog

Full-screen dialogs group a series of tasks, such as creating a calendar entry with the event title, date, location, and time. Because they take up the entire screen, full-screen dialogs are the only dialogs over which other dialogs can appear.dia
