# Slider


[Sliders](https://material.io/components/sliders/) allow users to make
selections from a range of values.

## Using sliders


Sliders reflect a range of values along a bar, from which users may select a single value. They are ideal for adjusting settings such as volume, brightness, or applying image filters.

Sliders can have icons on both ends of the bar that reflect a range of values.

### Installing sliders

In order to install with [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) first add the component to your `Podfile`:

```bash
pod 'MaterialComponents/Slider'
```

Then run the installer:

```bash
pod install
```

Then import the Slider target:


<!--<div class="material-code-render" markdown="1">-->

#### Swift
```swift
import MaterialComponents.MaterialSlider
```

#### Objective-C
```objc
#import "MaterialSlider.h"
```
<!--</div>-->



### Making sliders accessible

**Note to developers: include platform-specific accessibility information/settings**


**Types**

There are two types of sliders: 1\. [Continuous slider](#continuous-slider) and 2\.
[Discrete slider](#discrete-slider)

!["Slider examples of both continuous and discrete sliders."](assets/sliders_types.png)

A slider with one thumb is called a single point slider, and a slider with two thumbs is called a range slider.
### Anatomy and key properties

A slider has a track, one or two thumbs, and optional value label. A discrete
slider also has tick marks.

1.  Track
2.  Thumb
3.  Value label (optional)
4.  Tick mark (discrete sliders)

### Continuous sliders

Continuous sliders allow users to make meaningful selections that donâ€™t require
a specific value.

#### Continuous single point slider example

API and source code:

*   `MDCSlider`
    *   [Class definition](https://material.io/components/ios/catalog/sliders/api-docs/Classes/MDCSlider.html)
    *   [Class source](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/tree/develop/components/Slider)


**Note to developers: Provide a continuous single point slider example with code and screenshot with the following:**
* A track range from 0 to 100
* A thumb set to 70

#### Continuous range slider example

API and source code:


**Note to developers: Provide a continuous range slider example with code and screenshot with the following:**
* A track range from 0 to 100
* A lower-bound thumb set to 20
* An upper-bound thumb set to 70

### Discrete sliders

Discrete sliders display a numeric value label upon pressing the thumb, which
allows a user to input an exact value.

#### Discrete single point slider example

API and source code:

*   `MDCSlider`
    *   [Class definition](https://material.io/components/ios/catalog/sliders/api-docs/Classes/MDCSlider.html)
    *   [Class source](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/tree/develop/components/Slider)

*
**Note to developers: Provide a discrete single point slider example with code and screenshot with the following:**
* A track range from 0 to 100
* A thumb set to 70
* Tick marks set at 10

#### Discrete range slider example

API and source code:

*   ``
    *   [Class definition]()
    *   [Class source]()

**Note to developers: Provide a discrete range slider example with code and screenshot with the following:**
* A track range from 0 to 100
* A lower-bound thumb set to 20
* An upper-bound thumb set to 70
* Tick marks set at 10


## Theming sliders

Sliders support
[Material Theming](https://material.io/components/sliders#theming) and can be
customized in terms of color and typography.

### Slider theming example

API and source code:

*   `MDCSlider`
    *   [Class definition](https://material.io/components/ios/catalog/sliders/api-docs/Classes/MDCSlider.html)
    *   [Class source](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/tree/develop/components/Slider)


The following example shows a discrete range slider with Material's [Shrine](https://material.io/design/material-studies/shrine.html) theme.

**Note to developers: Provide a discrete range slider example that uses Shrine theming with code and screenshot with the following:**
* A track range from 0 to 100
* A lower-bound thumb set to 20
* An upper-bound thumb set to 70
* Tick marks set at 10
