# Selection controls: switches

[Selection controls](https://material.io/components/selection-controls#usage) allow the user to select options.

Switches toggle the state of a single setting on or off. They are the preferred way to adjust settings on mobile.

## Switches example

`switch`
* [Class definition](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Switch-class.html)
* [GitHub source](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/fabf4e3d0d311181178d2c601d29a2f739ea543a/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/switch.dart)
* [Demo site](insert link to demo site)

**Note to developers: Generate example code and a screenshot of the code render showing the following:**
* Provide a list of 5 switches
* Each switch is followed by text: "Switch 1" "Switch 2"... "Switch 5"
* "Switch 5" should be disabled

### Switch states

Switches can be on or off. Switches have enabled, hover, focused, and pressed states.

Display the outer radial reaction only on form factors that use touch, where interaction may obstruct the element completely.

For desktop, the radial reaction isn't needed.
