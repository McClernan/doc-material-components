## Types

There are three types suitable for different use cases: 1. [Standard bottom sheets](#standard-bottom-sheet) display content that complements the screen’s primary content and remain visible while users interact with the primary content, 2. [Modal bottom sheets](#modal-bottom-sheet) are an alternative to inline menus or simple dialogs on mobile and provide room for additional items, longer descriptions, and iconography, and must be dismissed in order to interact with the underlying content, and 3. [Expanding bottom sheets](#exapnding-bottom-sheet) provide a small, collapsed surface that can be expanded by the user to access a key feature or task to offer the persistent access of a standard sheet with the space and focus of a modal sheet.

## Standard bottom sheet

Standard bottom sheets co-exist with the screen’s main UI region and allow for simultaneously viewing and interacting with both regions. They are commonly used to keep a feature or secondary content visible on screen when content in main UI region is frequently scrolled or panned.

## Modal bottom sheet

Modal bottom sheets present a set of choices while blocking interaction with the rest of the screen. They are an alternative to inline menus and simple dialogs on mobile, providing additional room for content, iconography, and actions.

Modal bottom sheets are used in mobile apps only.

* **Collecting and acting on user selections** from a set of items, such as photos in a gallery
* **Supporting tasks**, such as chat and comments
* **Indirect navigation between items**, such as videos in a playlist

Expanding bottom sheets are recommended for use on mobile and tablet.
