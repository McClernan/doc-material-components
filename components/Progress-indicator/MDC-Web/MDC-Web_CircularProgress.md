# Circular progress indicators

[Circular progress indicators](https://material.io/components/progress-indicators#circular-progress-indicators) display progress by animating an indicator along an invisible circular track in a clockwise direction. They can be applied directly to a surface, such as a button or card.

## Using circular progress indicators


Circular progress indicators support both determinate and indeterminate processes.
* Determinate circular indicators fill the invisible, circular track with color, as the indicator moves from 0 to 360 degrees.
* Indeterminate circular indicators grow and shrink in size while moving along the invisible track.



_**Note: When displaying progress for a sequence of processes, indicate overall progress rather than the progress of each activity.**_
