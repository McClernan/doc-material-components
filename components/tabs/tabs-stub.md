## Fixed tabs

Fixed tabs display all tabs on one screen, with each tab at a fixed width. The width of each tab is determined by dividing the number of tabs by the screen width. They don’t scroll to reveal more tabs; the visible tab set represents the only tabs available.

### Fixed tab example

`api name`
* [Class definition](link to class API doc)
* [GitHub source](link to GitHub source)
* [Demo site](link to relevant demo)

The following example shows a row of of fixed tabs.

![Fixed tab example with 3 tabs, each tab has an icon](link to screenshot)


**Note to developers: Create a code example and screenshot with the following**
* A fixed row of three tabs, labeled:
    * "Tab 1"
    * "Tab 2"
    * "Tab 3"
* Tab 1 has a favorites icon
* Tab 2 has a music icon
* Tab 3 has a search icon
* Screenshot only: Tab 2 is shown as selected

## Scrollable tabs

Scrollable tabs are displayed without fixed widths. They are scrollable, such that some tabs will remain off-screen until scrolled.

### Fixed tab example

`api name`
* [Class definition](link to class API doc)
* [GitHub source](link to GitHub source)
* [Demo site](link to relevant demo)

The following example shows a row of of scrollable tabs.

**Note to developers: Create a code example and screenshot with the following**
* A scrollable row of five tabs, labeled:
    * "Tab 1"
    * "Tab 2"
    * "Tab 3"
    * "Tab 4"
    * "Tab 5"
* The screen shows only 3 tabs
