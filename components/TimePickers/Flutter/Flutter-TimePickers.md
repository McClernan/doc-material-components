### Mobile time pickers

Mobile time pickers can be used to specify time down to hours and minutes in a time period. They are displayed in a dialog.

* Setting an alarm
* Scheduling a meeting

Mobile time pickers allow selection of hours and minutes. They arenâ€™t ideal for selecting granular amounts of time, such as milliseconds for a stopwatch application.
