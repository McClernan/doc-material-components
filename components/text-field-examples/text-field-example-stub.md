The text field class consists of the following types:

* [Filled text](#filled-text)
* [Outlined text](#outlined-text)

## Using text fields

Text fields allow users to enter text into a UI. They typically appear in forms and dialogs.

### Installation

## Filled text

[Filled text fields](https://material.io/components/text-fields/#filled-text-field) have more visual emphasis than outlined text fields, making them stand out when surrounded by other content and components.

### Filled text example

Source code API:

* \<source class name\>
  * [Class definition](developer site here)
  * [GitHub source](https://github.com/materials-components/)

The following examples shows a filled text field.


_**Copy the image to your platform's assets folder. Use a screenshot of your render.**_


<img src="assets/.png" alt="filled text field for <platform> platform">

```
* The label text should read "Label text"
* The input text should read "Input text"
* The helper text should read "Helper text"
* The text field should have a character counter of up to 20 characters
* The text field should have a "favorite" leading icon
```

## Outlined text

[Outlined text fields](https://material.io/components/text-fields/#outlined-text-field) have less visual emphasis than filled text fields. When they appear in places like forms, where many text fields are placed together, their reduced emphasis helps simplify the layout.

### Outlined text example

Source code API:

* \<source class name\>
  * [Class definition](developer site here)
  * [GitHub source](https://github.com/materials-components/)

The following examples shows an outlined text field.

_**Copy the image to your platform's assets folder. Use a screenshot of your render.**_
<img src="assets/.png" alt="outlined text field for <> platform">

```
* The label text should read "Label text"
* The input text should read "Input text"
* The error message text should read "Error message" and display the error message
* The text field should have a trailing error icon
```

## Theming text fields

Text fields support [Material Theming](https://material.io/components/text-fields/#theming) and can be customized in terms of color, typography and shape.

### Text field theming example

API and source code:

* `\<Component platform API name\>`
    * [Class description](https://)
    * [GitHub source](https://github.com/material-components/)
    
The following example shows filled and outlined text fields with Material Theming.

!["Two text fields, one filled, one outlined, with green/black color theming and cut corners."](assets/button-theming.svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Implementing text field theming</b></summary>

```
Include source code for two side-by-side examples using a green/black color theme similar to the one used in the [Android button example](https://github.com/mingjane-work/doc-material-components/blob/mingjane-doc-branch/button-examples/Android/android-button-example.md):

* Include one filled text field with the following:
    * The label text should read "Label text"
    * The input text should read "Input text"
    * The helper text should read "Helper text"
    * The text field should have a character counter of up to 20 characters
    * The text field should have a "favorite" leading icon
    * The container should have cut corners instead of rounded
* Include one outlined text field with the following:
    * The label text should read "Label text"
    * The input text should read "Input text"
    * The error message text should read "Error message" and display the error message
    * The text field should have a trailing error icon
    * The container should have cut corners instead of rounded
