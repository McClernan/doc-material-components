# Linear progress indicators

[Linear progress indicators](https://material.io/components/progress-indicators#linear-progress-indicators) display progress by animating an indicator along the length of a fixed, visible track. The behavior of the indicator is dependent on whether the progress of a process is known.

## Using linear progress indicators

Linear progress indicators support both determinate and indeterminate operations.
* Determinate operations display the indicator increasing in width from 0 to 100% of the track, in sync with the processâ€™s progress.
* Indeterminate operations display the indicator continually growing and shrinking along the track until the process is complete.

_**Note: When displaying progress for a sequence of processes, indicate overall progress rather than the progress of each activity.**_
