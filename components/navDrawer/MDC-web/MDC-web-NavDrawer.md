## Standard navigation drawer

[Standard navigation drawers](https://material.io/components/navigation-drawer#standard-drawer) allow interaction with both screen content and the drawer at the same time. They can be used on tablet and desktop, but they aren’t suitable for mobile due to limited screen size.


## Model navigation drawer

[Modal navigation drawers](https://material.io/components/navigation-drawer#modal-drawer) block interaction with the rest of an app’s content with a scrim. They are elevated above most of the app’s UI and don’t affect the screen’s layout grid.


## Bottom navigation drawer

[Bottom navigation drawers](https://material.io/components/navigation-drawer#bottom-drawer) are modal drawers that are anchored to the bottom of the screen instead of the left or right edge. They are only used with bottom app bars.
