selections from a range of values.

## Using sliders

Sliders reflect a range of values along a bar, from which users may select a single value. They are ideal for adjusting settings such as volume, brightness, or applying image filters.

Sliders can have icons on both ends of the bar that reflect a range of values.

### Installing sliders

Use the following command to install the sliders component:

```bash
npm install @material/slider
```

### Making sliders accessible

**Note to developers: Add platform-specific accessibility instructions**

## Types

There are two types of sliders: 1\. [Continuous slider](#continuous-slider) and 2\.
[Discrete slider](#discrete-slider)

A slider with one thumb is called a single point slider, and a slider with two thumbs is called a range slider.
### Continuous sliders

Continuous sliders allow users to make meaningful selections that donâ€™t require
a specific value.

### Discrete sliders

Discrete sliders display a numeric value label upon pressing the thumb, which
allows a user to input an exact value.
