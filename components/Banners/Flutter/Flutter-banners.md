## Using banners

A banner displays an important, succinct message, and provides actions for users to address (or dismiss the banner). It requires a user action to be dismissed.

Banners should be displayed at the top of the screen, below a top app bar. Theyâ€™re persistent and nonmodal, allowing the user to either ignore them or interact with them at any time. Only one banner should be shown at a time.
