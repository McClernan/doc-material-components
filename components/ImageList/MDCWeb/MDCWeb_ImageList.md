## Using image lists

Image lists represent a collection of items in a repeated pattern. They help improve the visual comprehension of the content they hold.

### Installing image lists

### Making image lists accessible

## Types

There are four types of image lists: 1\. [Standard image lists](#standard-image-lists) are best for items of equal importance. They have a uniform container size, ratio, and padding. 2\. [Quilted image lists](#quilted-image-lists) emphasize certain items over others in a collection. They create hierarchy using varied container sizes and ratios 3\. [Woven image lists](#woven-image-lists) facilitate the browsing of peer content. They display content in containers of varying ratios to create a rhythmic layout. 4\. [Masonry image lists](#masonry-image-lists) facilitate the browsing of uncropped peer content. Container heights are sized based on the image size.

### Standard image lists

Standard image lists are best for items of equal importance. They have a uniform container size, ratio, and padding.


### Quilted image lists

Quilted image lists emphasize certain items over others in a collection. They use varied container sizes and ratios to create hierarchy across images.

### Woven image lists

Woven image lists use alternating container ratios to create a rhythmic layout. A woven image list is best for browsing peer content.

### Masonry image lists

Masonry image lists use dynamically sized container heights that reflect the aspect ratio of each image. This image list is best used for browsing uncropped peer content.
