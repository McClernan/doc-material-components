## Using sliders

### Installing sliders

### Making sliders accessible

## Types

There are two types of sliders: 1\. [Continuous slider](#continuous-slider) and 2\.
[Discrete slider](#discrete-slider)

!["Slider examples of both continuous and discrete sliders."](assets/slider_types.png)

A slider with one thumb is called a single point slider, and a slider with two thumbs is called a range slider.
### Anatomy and key properties

A slider has a track, one or two thumbs, and optional value label. A discrete
slider also has tick marks.

### Continuous sliders

Continuous sliders allow users to make meaningful selections that donâ€™t require
a specific value.

#### Continuous single point slider example

API and source code:

*   ``
    *   [Class definition]()
    *   [Class source]()

**Note to developers: Provide a continuous single point slider example with code and screenshot with the following:**
* A track range from 0 to 100
* A thumb set to 70

#### Continuous range slider example

API and source code:

*   ``
    *   [Class definition]()
    *   [Class source]()

**Note to developers: Provide a continuous range slider example with code and screenshot with the following:**
* A track range from 0 to 100
* A lower-bound thumb set to 20
* An upper-bound thumb set to 70

### Discrete sliders

Discrete sliders display a numeric value label upon pressing the thumb, which
allows a user to input an exact value.

#### Discrete single point slider example

API and source code:

*   ``
    *   [Class definition]()
    *   [Class source]()

**Note to developers: Provide a discrete single point slider example with code and screenshot with the following:**
* A track range from 0 to 100
* A thumb set to 70
* Tick marks set at 10

#### Discrete range slider example

API and source code:

*   ``
    *   [Class definition]()
    *   [Class source]()

**Note to developers: Provide a discrete range slider example with code and screenshot with the following:**
* A track range from 0 to 100
* A lower-bound thumb set to 20
* An upper-bound thumb set to 70
* Tick marks set at 10


## Theming sliders

Sliders support
[Material Theming](https://material.io/components/sliders#theming) and can be
customized in terms of color and typography.

### Slider theming example

API and source code:

*   ``
    *   [Class definition]()
    *   [Class source]()
*   ``
    *   [Class definition]()
    *   [Class source]()

The following example shows a discrete range slider with Material's [Shrine](https://material.io/design/material-studies/shrine.html) theme.

**Note to developers: Provide a discrete range slider example that uses Shrine theming with code and screenshot with the following:**
* A track range from 0 to 100
* A lower-bound thumb set to 20
* An upper-bound thumb set to 70
* Tick marks set at 10
